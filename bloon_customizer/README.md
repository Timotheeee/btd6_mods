Provides and easy way to modify the game's bloons without writing any code
INSTRUCTIONS:
Launch the game and it should generate a bunch of files in Mods/bloon_customizer/original
Copy the files you want to modify to Mods/bloon_customizer/custom
You can now modify those files to change the bloon's stats such as its health, graphics, or which children it drops.
