select a tower then use the arrow keys to drive.

this mod can be used in 2 different modes, you can press f1 to switch between them.

by default, the car rotates when the tower does. this works well when combined with the first person mod.

when the independent targeting mode is enabled, towers can rotate independently from the car. use this if you aren't using the first person mod.
